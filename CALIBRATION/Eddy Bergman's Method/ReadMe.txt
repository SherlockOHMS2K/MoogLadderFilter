CALIBRATING THE FILTER:

Connect this filter to an oscilloscope and keep an eye on the output signal while inputting a squarewave from your VCO. 

Then set the trimmers to good resonance response and good signal amplitude over the full throw of the panel potentiometers. Then connect it to the VCA and trim again for best sound. It's a matter of experience but it's really not that difficult. You just need to use your logic. I can't really give you a procedure for calibrating.

Beware that the Resonance only works at the last bit of throw on the potentiometer. That is why you need a reversed logarithmic potentiometer, to stretch out the resistance in that area of the potentiometer and get more fine control over Resonance. 

This is a normal characteristic of the Moog Ladder Filter and there's not really anything you can do about it. All Moog Ladder Filters have this. You could say it's a design fault.
