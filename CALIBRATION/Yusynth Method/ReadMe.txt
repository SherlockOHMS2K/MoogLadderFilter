TRIMMING

V/Octave tracking :

    Apply 0.000V to the V/Oct input

    Turn the frequency knob fully counter-clockwise in order to measure 0mV at     the base of Q1.  Place your Negative lead of your Volt Meter on the Gnd point     on R31. Place the Positive lead on the POS Lead point on R9. * * * SEE TEST     POINT PHOTO * * * 

    Apply 1.000V to the V/Oct input
    Adjust T1 in order to measure 18.2mV at the base of Q1
    Apply 5.000V to the V/Oct input
    Check that you have 91.0mVat the base of Q1, if not adjust T1
    Apply 0.000V to the V/Oct input
    Set the filter to auto-oscillation (EMPHASIS turned fully clockwise)
    Connect a keyboard (CV/GATE) to the V/Oct input
    Play a tune and check the goodness of the tracking
    Slightly adjust T1 to achieve a good chromatic tracking.

Frequency range :

    Apply a sinewave with frequency 32Hz to the audio input
    Emphasis potentiometer to minimum resonance (fully counter-clockwise)
    Turn the frequency knob fully counter-clockwise
    Adjust T2, in order to mute the 32Hz signal.

Emphasis :

    Adjust T3 in order to reach auto-oscillation near 95% of the full range of the EMPHASIS pot.
